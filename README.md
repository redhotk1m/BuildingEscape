# BuildingEscape
My second project, where i'm learning C++ and Unreal Engine.

This is a 3D game, where the goal is the escape from a building. You can
* Pick up items, and drag  them around. (And of course let them go)
* Open doors when the combined weight of objects are within a certain zone (Collision zone)
* Open doors with your own weight, if it's enough to open the door (Might have to combine with other items)
# What i learned
- Unreal Engine 4 specific code / classes
- Level design in 3D
- Assets 
  - Static Mesh
  - Textures with roughness,ambience,ambient occlusion,normal & base color
  - Sounds
  - Actors
- Some aspects Unreal Physics Engine
- A lot of general C++, like pointers, references, structs, classes, arrays, etc..

Developed with Unreal Engine 4
